### Getting Started

This project provides a rule engine capable of evaluating complex eligibility conditions based on parameters like age, department, income, and experience. It allows dynamic rule creation, combination, and validation through a clear UI.

---

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime and package manager.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - For version control.

#### Cloning the Repository

Clone the project repository and navigate into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-handle/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

#### Installing Dependencies

Install project dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and specify the necessary environment variables (if any). Reference the `.env.example` file for required variables.

---

### Usage

To start the application locally:
```bash
npm start
```

For development (with auto-restart on file changes):
```bash
npm run dev
```

To test the application functionality, access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Codebase Structure

- `src/` - Contains main application code, including:
  - **Routes** - API endpoints.
  - **Controllers** - Handle request processing and business logic.
  - **Models** - Define data structures and rules.
  - **Utils** - Helper functions.
- `public/` - Static assets and frontend files.
- `.env.example` - Example environment variables file.
- `package.json` - Lists dependencies and project scripts.

---

### Dependencies

The application relies on the following dependencies:
1. **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime.
2. **Express** - Lightweight web framework for building API endpoints.
3. **NPM packages** - Listed in `package.json`.

---

### Design Choices

#### Key Design Patterns
1. **MVC Architecture** - Separates concerns for scalability and maintainability.
2. **RESTful API Design** - Provides a structured approach to accessing resources and methods.
3. **Frontend Framework** - Built with [specify framework if used, e.g., React].

#### Rule Parsing and Validation
- **Rule AST** - Creates an Abstract Syntax Tree for parsing and evaluating complex logical rules.
- **Custom Rule Functions** - Allows flexible rule creation and validation based on user-defined criteria.

---

### Testing

To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Tests are written using [mention testing framework here, e.g., Jest or Mocha]. They cover both unit and integration aspects, ensuring API accuracy and correct rule validation.
